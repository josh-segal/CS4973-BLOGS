# Microsoft and MySQL

## Who I Talked To

This week we had the chance to hear diverse perspectives from a a multitude of officials deeply involved in the intersection of international politics and technology. Ranging from the European Union, European Parliament, and the European Commission to the European Cyber Security Organisation and Microsoft Europe, I got a chance to hear how public officials and private executives view similar issues.

## What I learned 

The overarching theme I gleemed is that communication is key. Learning how to be a strong communicator and mediator is equally important as job-specific technical skills. A representative from [AmChamEU](https://www.amchameu.eu/) shared with us an anecode of software engineers creating a non-technical presentation for politicians, and being able to much more accurately communicate on shared issues after establishing shared understanding of each other's perspectives.

## The Project

Over this week, we architected our Entity-Relationship diagrams and converted them to a MySQL database schema, we also developed intial data viz and ML models, and drafted a wireframe PoC for our frontend app UI.

My role largely lied in the ER diagrams and MySQL schema. This process allowed me to gain a better understanding of crafting complex and efficient database structures for production grade applications.

## Future Directions

Over the coming weeks, I plan to not only further our project through the skills and tools we learn in class, but to also learn more about the culture and history of Luxembourg when we visit this coming weekend. My goal is to try the national dish "Judd mat Gaardebounen" which consists of smoked salmon and salted pork!
