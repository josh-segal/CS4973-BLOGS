# Week 3, Project Update

For this phase of the project I worked on the creation of fake data for the database. To accomplish a reasonable size for the fake data, I used the website Mockaroo  to create the schemas, and subsequently the data in a json format. To move the data into SQL, I used a python script to convert the rows into insert statements. Moreover, I worked on implementing our vision for the different app interfaces so that each user persona had its unique set of tools and uses. I first worked with Joshua to connect the yfinance data so that the investor persona could search for stocks and see its performance in the last year. This proved to be more challenging than expected and connecting the api took some time. Afterwards, I worked with Andrew to implement the manager wireframe. The main focus was to connect the politician data so that we could search politician and add them to the watchlist. My last contribution this week was to create the journalist profile and implement our desired use; it was relatively easy once the group had all the data ready to use. 

From a personal perspective, this week was extremely entertaining and getting to explore Luxembourg was very fulfilling. The group had the opportunity to hear a great presentation on June 4th from Pierre Dewitte about European data laws and its implications. I would like to thank the efforts of the group during the week and focus the last couple of days in refining our application.
