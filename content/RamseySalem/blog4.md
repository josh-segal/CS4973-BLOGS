For the final phase of this project, there were a few main things I worked on. I finally got the LSTM to work, after many attempts. It originally was never working on my computer, and then I sent my final to Dylan, and he ran it, and it worked. I then went on to debug my computer and find out the issue of why it never would run on my computer. I eventually created a new environment to run the file on and then it worked well. I then went on to make that a python file, where it could be implemented into stream lit, but I could not attempt implementing that because we did not have the stock data in a database. In the meantime, I worked on brainstorming more features for the website. Josh and I thought it was a good idea to add legislation data for the journalist persona, so I went web scraping. I spent a large amount of time scraping two websites that had embedded JavaScript, so I couldnâ€™t grab any data. I downloaded a csv file, cleaned the data in it, and saved it into a new csv that could be implemented into a database. As I waited for the linear regression to be implemented into the website, I made the elevator pitch and practiced it while I waited so I could try to implement my LSTM into stream lit. I also started the slides and the Read.me while our group was having trouble with the databases and stream lit. I also started practicing my script for the elevator pitch while trying to help implement my LSTM model.
